This project utilizes VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. The data is sourced into Microsoft Excel. The stock data has three sheets for year 2018,2019 and 2020.This is a large file so it may take long time to execute. A test data file which is a smaller file with six sheets(A-F) was used for testing.
